# Pong
My implementation of the classic game, Pong. This was written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Uses WPF for all the front-end visuals.

To play the game: 
1. Navigate to /Pong/bin/Realese/. Then download "Pong.exe" to your desktop
2. Double click the .exe
3. Enjoy

The game is bettter played in 2-Player mode, the single player needs some work to make the computer actually beatable. There is some overall issues, but I am working on fixing them.
